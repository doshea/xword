# Shared Project Board

Cross-persona handoffs. Keep this short — completed items get removed once deployed.

## Builder Pickup Rules

When a Builder picks up a plan:
1. **Timestamp it.** Add `Picked up by Builder at YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` to the item.
2. **Check for conflicts.** If an item already has a pickup timestamp within the last
   15 minutes, **do not pick it up** — another Builder is already working on it.
3. After 15 minutes with no commit, the pickup expires and the item is available again.

## Pending Deploy

Items built but not yet deployed to production.

_(Nothing pending — all clear.)_
